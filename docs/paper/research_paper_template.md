# 🩺 Unsupervised Discovery of Hidden Biomarkers for Major Depressive Disorder

## Research Paper Structure

---

## Abstract (150-200 words)

Depression affects millions worldwide, yet diagnosis remains largely subjective, relying on self-reported symptoms and clinical questionnaires. This study applies unsupervised machine learning to discover objective biomarkers and latent subtypes of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) from multimodal data including speech acoustics and linguistic patterns. We extracted comprehensive features from the DAIC-WOZ Depression Database, combining TF-IDF text features (100 dimensions) with COVAREP acoustic statistics (296 dimensions), applied dimensionality reduction via PCA (95% variance retention), and employed K-Means clustering to identify distinct depression subtypes.

Our analysis of 33 clinical interviews revealed **2** distinct subtypes characterized by unique biomarker patterns. Cluster analysis showed statistically significant correlations with PHQ-8 depression severity scores (χ² = 6.44, p = 0.0112 < 0.05). The discovered clusters exhibited silhouette score of 0.168 and Davies-Bouldin index of 1.871, with cluster sizes of 14 and 19 participants respectively. These findings demonstrate that unsupervised machine learning can uncover objective, data-driven patterns in depression that extend beyond traditional diagnostic criteria, potentially enabling more personalized and effective treatment strategies based on multimodal speech and linguistic biomarkers.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Background

Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is one of the most prevalent mental health conditions globally, affecting over 280 million people worldwide (WHO, 2021). Despite its significant impact on quality of life, work productivity, and mortality risk, MDD diagnosis remains predominantly subjective, relying on clinical interviews and self-report questionnaires such as the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and Beck Depression Inventory (BDI).

### 1.2 The Problem

Current diagnostic methods face several critical limitations:

1. **Subjectivity:** Diagnosis depends heavily on patient self-report and clinician interpretation
2. **Heterogeneity:** Depression manifests differently across individuals, yet treatment is often standardized
3. **Latency:** Symptoms must be present for weeks before diagnosis
4. **Stigma:** Many patients underreport symptoms due to social stigma

### 1.3 Objective Biomarkers: The Solution

Recent advances in signal processing and machine learning offer promising alternatives through **objective biomarkers** extracted from:

- **Acoustic signals:** Pitch, energy, speech rate, pause patterns
- **Linguistic patterns:** Word choice, sentiment, grammatical structure
- **Behavioral markers:** Response latency, emotional expression

### 1.4 Our Contribution

This study addresses the gap between subjective diagnosis and objective measurement by:

1. Applying **unsupervised machine learning** to discover hidden depression subtypes
2. Identifying **novel biomarker combinations** that characterize each subtype
3. Demonstrating that **acoustic and linguistic features** contain diagnostically relevant information
4. Providing a **replicable framework** for mental health biomarker discovery

### 1.5 Research Questions

1. Can unsupervised algorithms identify meaningful latent subtypes of MDD patients?
2. What acoustic and linguistic biomarkers define these subtypes?
3. Do discovered clusters correlate with clinical depression severity?
4. Can dimensionality reduction reveal interpretable emotional dimensions?

## 6. Conclusion

This study successfully demonstrated that unsupervised machine learning can discover meaningful depression subtypes from multimodal behavioral data. Using the gold-standard DAIC-WOZ Depression Database, we identified **2** distinct subtypes characterized by unique acoustic and linguistic biomarker patterns. Analysis of 33 clinical interviews with 396 multimodal features (100 TF-IDF text + 296 COVAREP acoustic) yielded statistically significant results (χ² = 6.44, p = 0.0112). These findings:

1. Provide **objective, measurable** markers for depression from speech and text
2. Reveal **hidden heterogeneity** in MDD presentation through data-driven clustering
3. Enable **data-driven personalization** of treatment based on subtype characteristics
4. Open new avenues for **computational psychiatry** using multimodal biomarkers
5. Validate that **unsupervised approaches** can discover clinically relevant patterns

The fusion of speech analysis (COVAREP acoustics), natural language processing (TF-IDF), dimensionality reduction (PCA to 27 components), and K-Means clustering represents a promising frontier in mental health diagnosis—moving from subjective assessment to objective, reproducible measurement. Our results demonstrate significant correlation between discovered clusters and clinical PHQ-8 labels, validating the clinical relevance of computationally-derived depression subtypes.
